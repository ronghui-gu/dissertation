\chapter{Concurrent CertiKOS Framework}
\label{chap:con}

In this Chapter, we will show how to
extend the sequential \CTOS{} framework
with the global log
to support concurrent program reasoning.
Section~\ref{sec:layer} introduces
the concurrent abstract machine with
global log, which extends the layer calculus
to support concurrent abstraction layers.
In Section~\ref{sec:mach},
we show a chain of concurrent
machine models from
multicore hardware machine
to a CPU-local machine.
Therefore,  most of the concurrent code
can be verified similar to sequential code,
making it possible to reuse lots of tools
developed in the sequential \CTOS{} framework.
\ignore{In Section~\ref{sec:comp},
we show how to equip CompCertX
with algebraic memory model to form a verified \emph{thread-safe} C compiler.}
