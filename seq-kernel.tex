\chapter{Case Study: Building Certified Sequential OS Kernels}
\label{chap:seq:kernel}
\ignore{\section{Overview of Certified Sequential Kernels}}
To demonstrate the power of our new languages and tools,
we have applied our new layered approach to specify and
verify four variants of sequential \mCTOS{} kernels in the Coq proof assistant.
This Chapter presents how to verify  these kernels as a case study and the benefits of our layered approach.

The \mCTOSbase{} base kernel is a simplified uniprocessor version of
the CertiKOS kernel~\cite{gu11} designed for the 32 bit x86
architecture.  It provides a multi-process environment for user-space
applications using separate virtual address space, where the
communications between different applications are established by
message passing.  The \mCTOShyper{} kernel, built on top of the base
kernel, is a realistic hypervisor kernel that can boot recent versions
of unmodified Linux operating systems (Debian 6.0.6 and Ubuntu
12.04.2).  The \mCTOSringz{} kernel extends the hypervisor supporting
``ring 0'' processes, hosting ``certifiably safe'' services and
application programs inside the kernel address space.  Finally, we
strip the last kernel down to the \mCTOSembed{} kernel, removing
virtualization, virtual memory, and user-space interrupt handling.
This results in a minimal operating system suitable for embedded
environments.

This Chapter is organized as below:
In Section~\ref{sec:seq:design}, we present
our principles to introduce new layers.
Section~\ref{sec:seq:base} shows
how to build certified layers for  a sequential kernel
\mCTOS{}.
Based on this one,
Section~\ref{sec:seq:extend}
describes how to build variants of different sequential
kernels in our layered approach.

\section{Extensions to \mCTOS{}}
\label{sec:seq:extend}

One primary advantage of our extensible architecture is that it makes
certified kernel extension and reasoning much easier and more principled. 
In this section, we first describe three alternative \mCTOSbase{} kernels
that we created through relatively minor changes to the base kernel. We
then present a specific example of global reasoning over the \mCTOSbase{} 
kernel~--- a simple notion of address space isolation that will serve as 
a starting point for a full-fledged security proof in the future.

% \subsection{Alternative \mCTOSbase{} kernels}

\paragraph{\mCTOShyper{}: supporting virtualization}
We augmented \mCTOSbase{} to support the two hardware-assisted
virtualization technologies Intel VT-x and AMD SVM, and built a
certified hypervisor \mCTOShyper{}.
%To build a certified hypervisor, \mCTOSbase{} is augmented with the
%supports for the two hardware assistant technologies -- Intel VT-x and AMD SVM.
%The \mCTOShyper{} kernel provides core primitives to build full-fledged user
%level hypervisors including the operations for manipulating the
%virtual machine (VM) status, handling VM exits, starting/stopping a virtual
%machine, {\it etc}.
%It also hides the internal virtual machine control block
%and the nested page table from the guest applications.
%The current version supports one virtual machine.

Figure~\ref{fig:base:vm:layers} shows the 7 layers of the virtual
machine management of \mCTOShyper{} on the Intel platform.
%The virtual machine management utilizes the Intel hardware
%virtualization technology VT-x.
\ignore{
whose hardware behaviors were not modeled in \mCTOSbase{}
, such as the host/guest mode and the instructions to transfer between
host and guest mode (e.g., VMRUN, VMEXIT).
}
%In Fig. \ref{fig:base:vm:layers},
\code{VMInfo} is the layer object
that axiomatizes some of the hardware specific features needed
for the virtualization support. 
Since it is orthogonal to memory and process management,
the \code{VMInfo} object can be horizontally composed with the layers 
below \code{PProc} in \mCTOSbase{}.
On top of this extended \code{PProc} layer,
the virtual machine management extends the \emph{abstract memory model}
with the notions of Extended Page Table (EPT), the virtual machine
control structure (VMCS), and the virtual machine extension meta data (VMX),
which are abstracted into corresponding layer objects.
These objects are again orthogonal to the trap module above and can be
horizontally composed to export related system calls
%The VM related system calls are further exported to the trap module
with minimal cost.

\end{figure}

\ignore{
The issue is
that \mCTOSbase{} does not have support for starting a kernel module
that can be scheduled by the scheduler.  This can be addressed using
the notion of {\it ring 0 process} described in the next section.
}
\ignore{
A certified plug-in for supporting INTEL VMX virtualization is under
development.  As the virtualization interfaces are developed in an
architecture-independent way, replacing the SVM module with the VMX
one does not require much change to the proof side.
}
\ignore{
We can also slide in a thin
layer in between the process management and the virtualization module
to detect appropriate vendor information so that \mCTOShyper{}
can support both architectures.
}

\paragraph{Interesting Examples}
\begin{itemize}

\item For the address translation for guest OS, we introduce the abstract nested page table \verb"npt", which is a partial map from guest physical page index to a part of host physical page index and the permission. Since a guest OS can only be spawned by a user-level program, the domain of the \verb"npt" is in the high memory part and a subset of the physical pages allocated for the owner process. Since the virtual memory management guarantees that the physical memory of all user processes are disjoint, if we extend to support more than one virtual machines, the isolation of guest OS can be proved easily. 
\end{itemize}
}

\paragraph{\mCTOSringz{}: supporting ring 0 processes}

Thanks to the contextual refinement relation we have proved for
\mCTOSbase{}, one can certify user programs using our formal
specifications of system calls. This gives end-to-end proofs on
the behaviors of user programs when they run on \mCTOSbase{}.  
Furthermore, once certified, these processes can safely run in
the privileged ring 0 mode.  We extended \mCTOSbase{} into
\mCTOSringz{} by adding support for spawning ``in-kernel
processes'' that run in the privileged ring 0 mode. 
Ring 0 processes get much
better system call performance by directly calling kernel
functions and avoiding ring switch and interrupt processing. 
%A user process can run in the ring 0 mode
%only if it is verified for its safety,
%and stack consumption. 
%The latter property can be verified using techniques
%such as the one by Carbonneaux~\cite{veristack}.

To introduce ring 0 processes to \mCTOSbase{},
we added a single layer on top of the existing process management module:
Spawning a ring 0 process sets the initial \code{ESP} register to a
preallocated memory region and then spawns a proper kernel thread. The
memory region must be verifiably sufficient for the entire execution
of the process. 

%\vspace*{-10pt}
\paragraph{\mCTOSembed{}: embedded systems}
The \mCTOSembed{} kernel is intended for embedded settings. To develop
this kernel we started with \mCTOSringz{} and removed the virtual machine management, the virtual
memory management, and some of the process management layers that are
related to user contexts and user process management.  Thus
\mCTOSembed{} only supports ring 0 processes which run directly inside
the physical kernel address space instead of the user-level paged
virtual address space.

Removing plug-ins or layers does not take much effort.
We only need to alter the contextual refinement proof 
at the boundary so we can glue them back together.

\paragraph{Isolation in \mCTOSbase{}}
\label{security}
We have begun exploring the verification of a global security 
property on top of \mCTOSbase{}. As a starting point, we proved a basic notion of 
isolation between user-level processes running in different virtual 
address spaces. This isolation property is composed of two theorems:
one regarding integrity (write protection), and another regarding
confidentiality (read protection, or noninterference). 
The statements of these two theorems are as follows:
suppose the top layer abstract machine takes
one step, changing the machine state from $S$ to
$S'$, and let $p$ be the id of the currently-running process 
(which can be found in $S$).
\begin{description}
  \item[Integrity:]
If the value at some non-kernel memory location $l$ differs between
$S$ and $S'$, then $l$ belongs to a page that is mapped in the 
virtual address space of $p$.
\item[Confidentiality:]
\label{confidential}
If the step taken
is not a primitive call to an IPC syscall (send, recv, etc.), then the values
of memory in any address space other than $p$'s cannot have an effect on the
result of the step. In other words, if we altered $S$ 
by changing data in a different process's address space, the step would still 
have the same effect on $p$'s address space.
\end{description}

In the future, we plan to provide a more detailed
security policy by describing what can happen to confidentiality when IPC is used.
This description will be expressed in terms of propagation of security labels
on the IPC data. Note, however, that our framework allows for security labels
to be specified at a purely logical level~--- there is no need for
concrete representation and manipulation of labels at run time.

Noninterference properties are 
generally not preserved across refinement due to nondeterminism. It may therefore 
seem that the aforementioned \emph{confidentiality} holds only at the topmost layer, but not at
lower layers. It turns out, however, that our notion of deep specification
is strong enough to preserve noninterference. Essentially, to give 
a deep specification to a nondeterministic semantics, we must first externalize
the source of nondeterminism (\eg, into an oracle). The noninterference property
then becomes parameterized over this source of nondeterminism, which allows the
parameterized property to be preserved across refinement. This relationship 
between deep specification, noninterference, and refinement will be explored
comprehensively in future work.

The layer structures of these kernels are shown in the top half of
Fig.\ \ref{fig:kernel-layers};
each block in the top half represents a collection
of sub-layers shown in the bottom half (as we zoom in on \mCTOShyper).

\paragraph{\mCTOSbase{}}
The layered approach is the key to our success in fully certifying a kernel.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:clightx-prog}, we have shown how to define getters and
setters for abstract data types like those in Fig.\ \ref{fig:alt},
allowing higher layers to manipulate abstract states.
Furthermore, layering is also crucial to certification of thread queues
as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:overview}.
Instead of directly proving that a C linked-list implements a functional list,
we insert an intermediate layer as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:queue}
to divide the difficult task into two steps.

These may look like mere proof techniques for enabling abstract states
or reducing proof effort, but they echo the following mantra which 
makes our certification more efficient and scalable:
\begin{quote}
\emph{Abstract in minimal steps, specify \emph{full} behavior,
and hide \emph{all} underlying details.}
\end{quote}
This is also how we prove the overall contextual correctness
guarantees for all system calls and interrupt handlers.
Fig.~\ref{fig:pagefault-call-graph} shows the call graph of the page
fault handler, including all functions called both directly and
indirectly.  Circles indicate functions, solid arrows mean primitive
invocations, and faint dashed lines are primitives that are translated
by all the layers they pass through.

Defined in \textsf{TSysCall} layer interface, the page fault handler makes use of
\textsf{proc\_exit} and \textsf{proc\_start}, both defined in \textsf{PProc}d layer interface.
Since the invocations of them are separated by other primitive calls,
one may expect that the invariants need to be re-established or
the effects of the in-between calls re-interpreted.
Fortunately, as our mantra suggests, when the in-between layers translate
the two primitives to \textsf{TTrap} layer interface, the behaviors of them are
\emph{fully} specified in terms of \textsf{TTrap}'s abstract states,
and the invariants of \textsf{PProc} layer interface are considered the underlying
details and have \emph{all} been hidden.
This is especially important for calls like \textsf{proc\_exit} to
\textsf{ikern\_set} which span over 20 layers with the abstract states
so different that direct translation is not feasible.

\hrulefill
\end{figure}

Finally, kernel initialization is another difficult task
that has been missing from other kernel verification projects.

Previous efforts on certifying initialization have led to massive duplication
of logical components as shown in \cite{vaynberg12}.

The key observation that frees us from such burden is that the traditional
kernel initialization process is not compatible with
\emph{``specify full behavior and hide all underlying details.''}
For example, \textsf{start\_kernel} in Linux
kernel \footnote{\url{https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/init/main.c\#L501}}
makes a sequence of calls to module initializations.  \mCTOSbase's
initialization (see its call graph in
Fig.\ \ref{fig:mcertikos-init-call-graph}) is a \emph{chain} of calls
to layer initializations; this pattern complies with the guideline that 
initializing one layer should
hide the detail about initializing the lower layers.
%and makes certification possible without extra constructs.
Without layering, the specifications of \emph{all} functions will be populated
with initialization flags for each module they depend on. This
makes encapsulation harder and could also lead to
a quadratic blowup in size and proving effort.

\paragraph{\mCTOShyper{}}
The \mCTOShyper{} kernel provides core primitives to build
full-fledged user-level hypervisors by supporting one of the two
popular hardware virtualization technologies -- AMD SVM.  The primitives
include the operations for manipulating the virtual machine status,
handling VMEXITs, starting or stopping a virtual machine, {\it etc}.
The details of virtualization, e.g., the virtual machine control block
and the nested page table, are hidden from the guest applications.
The hypervisor functionalities are implemented in nine layers and then
inserted in between process management and interrupt handling layers.
The layered approach allows us to do so while (1) only modeling
virtualization-specific structures when needed; (2) retaining
primitives in the layer interface \textsf{PProc} by systematic lifting; and
(3) adding new primitives (including a new initialization function)
guaranteed not to interfere with existing primitives.

%\vspace*{-8pt}
\paragraph{\mCTOSringz{}}
The \mCTOSringz{} kernel explores a different dimension---instead
of adding intermediate layers, we augmented a few existing layers 
(in \mCTOShyper{}) with support of ring 0 processes.
The main modification is at
\textsf{PProc}, where an additional kind of threads is defined.
However, all the layers between \textsf{PProc} and \textsf{TSysCall} also
need to be extended to expose the functionality as system calls.
Thankfully, since all the new primitives are already described in deep
specifications, lifting them to system calls only requires equality
reasoning in Coq.

%\vspace*{-8pt}
\paragraph{\mCTOSembed{}}
The \mCTOSembed{} kernel cuts features down to a bare minimum: it does
not switch to user mode, hence does not require memory protection and
does not provide system call interfaces.  This requires \emph{removing}
features instead of adding them.  Since the layered structure minimizes
entanglements by eliminating unnecessary dependencies and code coupling,
the removal process was relatively easy and straightforward.
Moreover, removing the top 12 layers requires no additional
specifications for those now top-level primitives---deep specifications
are suitable for both internal reasonings and external descriptions.  Thread and process
management layers now sit directly on top of physical memory
management; virtual memory is never enabled.  The
layers remain largely the same barring the removal of primitives
mentioning page tables.}
