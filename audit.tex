\chapter{Independence Auditing}
\label{sec-audit}

%Independence auditing is \app's core function.
After dependency data acquisition,
\app performs independence auditing to generate
auditing reports.

As described in $\S$\ref{sec-INDArc}, \app supports
two scenarios.
We first present a
{\em structural independence auditing} protocol in $\S$\ref{subsec-IndAna},
which assumes data sources are willing
to provide the auditing agent with the full dependency data,
\eg, for auditing a common cloud provider.
We later present a
{\em private independence auditing} protocol in $\S$\ref{subsec-pia}
to support analysis across multiple cloud providers
unwilling to reveal the full dependency data to anyone.

%After the auditing agent collects the raw dependency information
%from the data sources,
%the agent generates an explicit graph representation
%for use by the pluggable analysis modules,
%as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-auditing}.

%Using the same example in $\S$\ref{sec-dep},
%shown in Figure~\ref{fig-example}, the \ft of
%one of replication deployments,
%using $S1$ and $S2$ for redundancy,
%is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-ft}(c).
