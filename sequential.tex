\chapter{Sequential CertiKOS Framework}
\label{chap:seq}
In this Chapter, we will provide the formal details
of our sequential \CTOS{} framework.
Section~\ref{sec:seq:layer} introduces
a layer calculus to compose
sequential layers vertically and
horizontally, starting from \emph{layer semantics units}
(which are language-dependent).
This layer calculus is general enough,
such that it is not bound to any specific language,
and the components of layer interfaces
and types of primitives are treated as parameters. 
In Section~\ref{sec:seq:sound},
we show the proof structure for the soundness of layer calculus.
Section~\ref{sec:seq:clight}
and Section~\ref{sec:seq:lasm}
show how to construct layer semantics units
and apply layer calculus
in ClightX (\ie, a C-like language) and LAsm (\ie, an assembly language), respectively.
In Section~\ref{sec:seq:comp},
we introduce CompCertX (\ie, a verified C compiler)
to compile ClightX layers down to assembly level,
and show how to link the result layers with
LAsm layers.
